# Car Sale Price Prediction

## Overview
This personal project focuses on predicting the selling prices of used cars using a regression model. The project is based on a dataset comprising over 100,000 entries of various car listings. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model selection to create a reliable prediction model.

## Project Highlights
- Utilized Python libraries, including Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, for data analysis and visualization.
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
- Performed bivariate analysis to uncover correlations between variables.
- Engineered features to improve model performance.
- Implemented a variety of regression models for prediction.

## Model Selection
After rigorous experimentation and comparative study of various regression models, the Gradient Boosting model emerged as the most suitable. It achieved an R-squared (R2) score of 0.89, indicating its strong predictive capability.

## Repository Structure
The project's repository includes the following files and directories:
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks documenting the step-by-step process of the project.
- `README.md`: The main readme file summarizing the project.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore detailed project notebooks.
3. Review the source code in the `src/` directory for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model creation.
4. Experiment with different models or modify feature engineering techniques to further enhance the prediction performance.
